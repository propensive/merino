## Status

Merino is classified as __fledgling__. Propensive defines the following five stability levels for open-source projects:

- _embryonic_: for experimental or demonstrative purposes only, without any guarantees of longevity
- _fledgling_: of proven utility, seeking contributions, but liable to significant redesigns
- _maturescent_: major design decisions broady settled, seeking probatory adoption and refinement
- _dependable_: production-ready, subject to controlled ongoing maintenance and enhancement; tagged as version `1.0` or later
- _adamantine_: proven, reliable and production-ready, with no further breaking changes ever anticipated

Merino is designed to be _small_. Its entire source code currently consists of 611 lines of code.

## Building

Merino can be built on Linux or Mac OS with Irk, by running the `irk` script in the root directory:
```sh
./irk
```

This script will download `irk` the first time it is run, start a daemon process, and run the build. Subsequent
invocations will be near-instantaneous.

We suggest that all contributors read the [Contributing Guide](/contributing.md) to make the process of

Please __do not__ contact project maintainers privately with questions. While it can be tempting to repsond to
such questions, private answers cannot be shared with a wider audience, and it can result in duplication of
effort.
